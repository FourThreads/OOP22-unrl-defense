This is the repository of a small project made for the Object Oriented Programming exam.

## Game Mechanics
The game consist in a world map where the player needs to stop an evil army from capturing its castle.

The two main defenses are: Towers, that cost gold, and spells, that have to be recharged via the passing of time.
Killing an enemy drops gold and the player has to manage its financies in order to make the best out of its resources deciding when it's best to build a new tower or to rely on its spells.
The enemys are fierce and the player will ecounter goblins, quick but fragile, and orcs, slow but resilient.
