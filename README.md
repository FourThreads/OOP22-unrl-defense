# Unreal Defense
## A strategic tower defense game with a fantasy ambientation 
This the repository of a little project made for the Object Oriented Programming exam.
## Premise
The game is still a work in progress and, for now, not even working. Any part of the code should be considered temporary.
## Game Mechanics
The game consist in a world map where the player can interact in order to stop an evil army from capturing its castle.

The two main defenses are: Towers, that cost gold, and potions, that have to be recharged via the passing of time.
Killing an enemy drops gold and the player has to manage its financies in order to make the best out of its resources decinding when it's best to build a new tower or to rely on its spells.
The enemys are fierce and the player will ecounter goblins, quick but fragile, and orcs, slow but resilient.
